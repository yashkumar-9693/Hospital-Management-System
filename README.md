This project is a full-stack web application designed to digitalize hospital operations. It enables patient registration, appointment booking, admin and doctor management, and secure message handling. The system is built using MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) with Cloudinary for file storage and MongoDB Atlas for database management. It consists of three modules: Frontend (patient interface), Backend (API & database), and Dashboard (admin panel). The project ensures efficient, secure, and user-friendly hospital management.
